The CCHS Table Tennis Club was founded in the fall of 2023 at Concord-Carlisle High School. What began as a casual space for students to enjoy the sport has grown into one of the school’s largest and most active clubs. In just two years, the club has expanded to a leadership team of fourteen and now hosts weekly meetings with approximately 25 regular attendees.

The club is driven by a clear mission: to bring people together through table tennis while giving back to the community. Through our tournaments and outreach efforts, we have introduced over 200 people to the sport and raised over $3,000 in support of ovarian cancer research at Dana-Farber and Alzheimer’s research at Massachusetts General Hospital.
